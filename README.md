Corey's Portfolio Showcase

The purpose of this project is to provide an information on myself and create a portfolio showcasing various skills via html and css.

The portfolio includes:

My name
An image of me
Links to my deployed work and ui scrolls to sections on my page when clicked on nav links - more to come on once further work completed
The first project is displayed larger than the rest.
A Responsive layout - on one section more needed.
Footer links which navigate to selected application. 

See below screen shots of my portfolio page:
