        <h1> A short story </h1>
        <p> Good day, I welcome you to the portfolio of Corey. Here you will find blood, sweat and code. 
            Where it all started: well, as a fish? no. Having spread my wings and fled the comfort of my bedroom I found myself digging deep into music technology and more specifically music production where I've spent many years ruining my ears!
            Through trial and error and self teaching I've reached a level whereas i can recreate a song within a DAW just by listening a few times around, awesome right! 
            Fast forward a few years and i'm ready to take my skills further, being invested heart and head into cryptocurreny and blockchain technologies I find myself partaking in a full stack web development boot-camp, the rest is history.
         </p>
